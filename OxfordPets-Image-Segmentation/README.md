### Semantic Image Segmentation with Xception-style U-Net
----

In this project, we will build a xception-style U-Net model for a image classification task.
The dataset is the Oxford-IIIT Pet Dataset, which contains 37 category pet dataset with roughly 200 images for each class. The images have a large variations in scale, pose and lighting. All images have an associated ground truth annotation of breed, head ROI, and pixel level trimap segmentation.

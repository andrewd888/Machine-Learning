# Churn Predition of Bank Customers
We build various models to predict the probability of customer churn. For the machine learning part, XGBoost,LightGBM,RandomForest and ensemble classifiers of them were built and optimized via Optuna. 
We also used TabNet, which is a deep learning architecture specifically designed for tabular data for model comparison. 
We discovered that for tabular data classification tasks, gradient boosted machines are still the best options.
